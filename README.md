# iMage
 
Example project for my course Advanced Software Engineering at the DHBW Karlsruhe.

With this program you can select images on your system and create mosaics with different tile sizes and shapes.
This can have a significant impact on the quality of the resulting image. So feel free to experiment with your own images. 

## Installation

The project was programmed with Eclipse IDE, but should work with IntelliJ too.

In Eclipse the project can be directly cloned and imported from GitHub.

In the URI field you just need to paste the link to the GitHub repository and then click through the wizard to clone the project.

After cloning the project you may also need to import the project by switching to the Git perspective via the icon in the upper right corner.
Then you need to right-click the cloned repository and click on Import Projects to select the project in the repository which the gets imported into the Eclipse workspace.

When the import is complete, you should be able to simply run the project by right-clicking the project name and selecting Run as > Java Application. 
Another way is by having the project selected and then clicking on the green arrow button on the upper side of the screen. 

To successfully run the project you may need to check the correct Java version since the project was programmed in Java 17.

## Testing

All test classes can be executed in Eclipse by right-clicking src/test/java and selecting Run as > JUnit Test.
